### Hi there !

I'm Brian Kariuki, a curious human and aspiring web scientist.

The internet is like the ocean, vast and mostly unexplored. I mostly enjoy surfing and deep sea diving. Stay safe, be kind and avoid the sharks.


- ğŸ”­ Learning Dart, Flutter and how to be more eco-friendly
- ğŸŒ± Working on a cool project
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about philosophy and meditation.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: mostly twitter
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...can't think of any rn but I promise I'm not that boring IRL.
